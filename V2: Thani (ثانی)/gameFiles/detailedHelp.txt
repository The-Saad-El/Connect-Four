                              CONNECT FOUR - HELP GUIDE

=====================================================================================

ABOUT THE GAME:
  Connect Four is a classic two-player strategy game where competitors take turns
  dropping colored discs into a vertical grid. The objective is simple yet
  challenging: connect four of your discs in a row (horizontally, vertically, or
  diagonally) before your opponent does. Victory requires both offensive strategy
  and defensive awareness!

HOW TO WIN:
  Be the first player to connect four of your discs consecutively in any direction:
    - Horizontally: Four discs side by side in the same row (left to right)
    - Vertically: Four discs stacked on top of each other in the same column
    - Diagonally: Four discs connected at 45-degree angles (both directions)
  
  If the board fills completely with no winner, the game ends in a draw.

HOW TO PLAY:
  1. When it's your turn, enter a column number (1 through the max column count)
  2. Your disc automatically falls to the lowest available position in that column
  3. Players alternate turns until someone achieves four-in-a-row or the board fills
  4. Plan ahead! Consider both your winning opportunities and blocking opponent threats
